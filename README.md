# Escape Room Template

[Live Page](https://esdidubs.github.io/escape-template/)

This is a template for user's to make their own escape game that looks like
the ones I've made. The user puts in the types of locks they want and the
number of clues they want to offer, and the tool spits out the html code for
them. The only things needed by the user are the clues within a folder
called img.
